It can **remember** the user's name and use it in future responses, creating a more personalized interaction.

## Email Agent

An email assistant agent designed to help craft emails for both **professional** and **casual** purposes.  
It also **stores the last generated email** in its state, allowing for easy reuse or further editing.
